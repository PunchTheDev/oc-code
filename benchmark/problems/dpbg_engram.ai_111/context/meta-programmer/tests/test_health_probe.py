"""Tests for post-deploy health probe and auto-rollback (Phase E1.9.2).

Covers:
- run_health_probe: pass, import-error, missing file, timeout
- deploy_atomically with probe_timeout: rollback over existing file,
  removal of newly-created broken file, and pass-through for healthy artifact.
- Default behaviour (probe_timeout=0): import-time crashes are not caught
  (only syntax is checked), i.e. the probe is opt-in.
