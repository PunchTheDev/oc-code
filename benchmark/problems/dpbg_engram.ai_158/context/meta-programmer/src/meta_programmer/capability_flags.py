"""
M1 prerequisite gate for Meta-Programmer autonomy.

The meta-programmer may not process knowledge gaps (generate or deploy code)
until two M1 safety controls are confirmed live:

  1. Decision-bus signing (Task 1.2) — all kernel decisions carry a
     cryptographic signature; forgery by another service is detectable.
  2. Sandbox fail-closed hardening (E1.3.2) — the sandbox refuses to run when
     containment cannot be fully applied; there is no partial-isolation fallback.

Both controls are tracked via environment variables set by ops/CI when the
corresponding milestone work ships. Until both are confirmed, every incoming
``knowledge.gap`` is refused with a denial so the meta-programmer cannot acquire
new capabilities during an unsafe window.

Env vars (set to "1", "true", or "yes" to enable; anything else → incomplete):
  ENGRAM_DECISION_BUS_SIGNING_ENABLED   — Task 1.2 complete
  ENGRAM_SANDBOX_FAIL_CLOSED_ENABLED    — E1.3.2 complete

See: CLAUDE.md §3 (Safety Architecture), docs/SANDBOX-THREAT-MODEL.md §3,
     GitHub issue #140.
