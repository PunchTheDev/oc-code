Engram detects its environment, learns from every interaction, and improves over time — on whatever machine it runs on. Open `localhost:8080` and you see a living system: a neuromorphic brain learning inside a MuJoCo physics simulation, not a static admin panel.

> **Project status:** Engram is an **active research project**, not production-ready
> software. The architecture is implemented and unit-tested, but not yet validated
> at scale or in real time on physical robots. It is released under the MIT License
> to invite contributors — see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for an honest

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Environment Awareness** | Detects and adapts to ANY machine — OS, hardware, services, APIs, capabilities |
| **Skills as API Calls** | Abstracted skill registry — `env.detect`, `brain.chat`, `env.docker`, etc. |
| **Data Flywheel** | Every interaction feeds back: teleoperation → observation → deployment → learning |
| **Unified Intelligence** | One system with categorized skills, not disconnected services |
| **Self-Improvement** | Background health checks, anomaly detection, knowledge accumulation |

### The Data Flywheel

Engram learns from 4 sources:

```
    ┌─── Teleoperation ───┐
    │   (human chat)       │
    ▼                      │
┌──────┐              ┌──────┐
│  AI  │◄────────────│ Data │
│  🧠   │             │  📊  │
└──────┘              └──────┘
    │                      ▲
    ▼                      │
    ├─── Observation ──────┤   (NATS messages, system monitoring)
    ├─── Deployment ───────┤   (self-generated health checks)
    └─── Simulation ───────┘   (synthetic/test data)
```

Every chat message, every system observation, every health check feeds the flywheel. The system gets smarter as it runs.

## Quick Start

Engram runs with **pure Python — no Docker required**. A launcher (`run.py`)
downloads and manages NATS automatically, then starts the services as native
processes. See **[RUN-LOCAL.md](RUN-LOCAL.md)** for the complete guide.

```bash
# 1. (recommended) create a virtualenv and install deps
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Windows  (use: source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
python run.py --install

# 2. start the core profile (NATS auto-managed + brain, kernel, dashboard, ...)
python run.py

# 3. open the dashboard
#    http://localhost:8080

# Other options:
python run.py --list              # show all services and what they need
python run.py --profile full      # also start Qdrant/Ollama-backed services
python run.py --only kernel,planner
```

**Optional infrastructure** (only for the `full` profile):
- **Ollama** (AI chat / cognitive bridge) — install from https://ollama.com, then
  `ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b`.
- **Qdrant** (vector memory) — run the `qdrant` server, then `python run.py --profile full`.

---

## Dashboard

### System Awareness
Deep environment detection — not just "what OS":
- Hardware: CPU model, cores, RAM, disk, GPU
- Services: What's listening on which ports
- APIs: NATS, Ollama, Qdrant availability
- Capabilities: What the system can do (`docker_orchestration`, `local_llm`, `nats_messaging`, etc.)
- Docker: Container CPU, memory, network metrics in real-time

### Skill Registry
Abstracted, categorized skills with execution tracking:

| Category | Skills |
|---|---|
| 👁️ **Perception** | Environment Detection, Resource Monitor, Container Orchestration |
| 🧠 **Cognition** | Conversational Reasoning, Self-Improvement Loop, Knowledge Base |
| 📡 **Communication** | NATS Message Bus, WebSocket Stream |

Each skill tracks: call count, error rate, average latency, last invocation.

### Teleoperation (Chat)
The chat interface is the human guidance channel:
- LLM has full system context (hardware, resources, capabilities, services)
- Maintains conversation history
- Every message feeds the data flywheel
- Connects to Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

### Data Flywheel Visualization

## Architecture

### The Cognitive Stack

Engram has two brains: a **neuromorphic cognitive core** (spiking neural network that IS the intelligence) and an **LLM** (external knowledge source, like a teacher/book).

The neuromorphic core is a spiking neural network (currently **1,056,800 neurons** training on Hetzner; hierarchical layers active across 13 regions, 48 synapse groups, 1.31B synapses) with Hebbian/STDP learning. Intelligence emerges from:
1. **Multi-modal binding** — simultaneous sensory inputs bind together through temporal correlation
2. **Predictive world model** — learns temporal sequences, prediction errors drive learning
3. **Homeostatic drives** — energy, damage, temperature, fatigue create needs and motivations

```
Layer 5: External Knowledge (LLM/Ollama)        <- "teacher" — consulted, not core
            |
Layer 4: Higher Cortex (Planner/Coordinator)     <- planning, reasoning
            |  via NATS
Layer 3: Association + Prediction (Neuromorphic)  <- multi-modal binding, world model
            |
Layer 2: Sensory + Motor Cortex (Neuromorphic)   <- perception, movement
            |
Layer 1: Brainstem + Reflexes (Neuromorphic)      <- survival, drives, innate responses
            |  via NATS
         Kernel (safety gate) -> Motor Feedback Adapter -> Body (MuJoCo / real hardware)
```

> This layering diagram is logical (from the brain's perspective). Physically, these layers run as parallel Docker services communicating via NATS. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the runtime component structure.

### Brain Regions (1M PoC: 1,001,800 neurons, 11 regions, 24 synapse groups, 1.19B synapses)

| Region | Neurons | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Brainstem | 15K | Homeostatic drives (energy, damage, temp, fatigue) |
| Reflex Arc | 10K | Fast hardwired responses (pain withdrawal, grip, startle) |
| Sensory Cortex | 200K | Encodes raw input (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive) |
| Motor Cortex | 100K | Movement generation (locomotion, manipulation, head, expression) |
| Cerebellum | 100K | Motor coordination via efference copy |
| Association Cortex | 200K | Multi-modal binding — concept formation via STDP |
| Predictive Layer | 100K | Temporal sequence learning + world model (R-STDP) |
| Working Memory | 25K | Sustained attention via strong recurrent connections |

**Hierarchical additions** (Phase 8 — implemented, currently active via docker-compose.yml):

| Region | Neurons (active) | Target (full scale) | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature Layer | 20K | 80K | Intermediate feature integration (V4/IT-like), pools simple features into complex combinations |
| Concept Layer | 5K | 10K | Information bottleneck with k-WTA (2% sparsity). Abstract, modality-invariant concept SDRs |
| Meta-Controller | 3K | 6K | Neuromodulatory hub — outputs DA, ACh, NE, 5-HT signals to gate plasticity across all regions |
| Pattern Separator | 10K | 10K | Sparse expansion for episodic binding (dentate gyrus analog) |
| Global Workspace | 5K | 10K | Cross-region broadcast hub for conscious access (global workspace theory) |

### How Learning Works

The brain uses a **three-factor learning rule**:

```
Factor 1 (pre-synaptic):  When did the input neuron fire?
Factor 2 (post-synaptic): When did the output neuron fire?
Factor 3 (neuromodulator): Should this connection change?

Step 1: Spike coincidence → eligibility trace (temporary molecular tag)
Step 2: Neuromodulator (DA/ACh/NE/5-HT) → converts trace to permanent weight change
No modulator within ~1 second → trace decays, no learning
```

This enables **delayed reward** (the brain can learn from consequences that arrive seconds later) and **selective learning** (the meta-controller decides what to learn and what to consolidate).

### How Abstract Concepts Form

Concepts are NOT pre-built or labeled. They emerge through the processing hierarchy:

1. **Sensory features** → edges, frequencies, pressure (sensory cortex)
2. **Complex features** → shapes, phonemes, textures (feature layer, via STDP)
3. **Multi-modal binding** → "red + round + smooth = apple" (association cortex, via lateral STDP + gamma oscillations)
4. **Prototype extraction** → shared features across many "dog" experiences strengthen; unique features average out (association cortex, over time)
5. **Abstract SDR** → 200/10,000 sparse code, compressed, modality-invariant (concept layer, via k-WTA competition)
6. **Temporal abstraction** → "A causes B" patterns across concept-level representations (predictive layer, via R-STDP)
7. **Transfer** → same concept neurons activate for novel instances that share learned features (cross-domain generalization)

### Motor Feedback Loop (MuJoCo Virtual Body)

The brain closes the sensorimotor loop: motor cortex fires → motor command goes through the Kernel → physical simulation → proprioceptive feedback → STDP learning.

   │                                          │
   └─ [MuJoCo body]   ── physics simulation ──┘
          │
          ▼
   motor.outcome.{channel}  →  proprioceptive injection  →  STDP learns
```

**MuJoCo virtual body**: Configurable robot body simulated with MuJoCo physics (default: 22-body humanoid). Motor channels map to joint actuators via `MotorFeedbackConfig.channel_actuators`; speech and expression use stochastic feedback. The body persists physics state and derives all joint mappings, fall thresholds, and proprioceptive vector size dynamically from the loaded model.

**Per-channel auto-detection**: If a real actuator publishes heartbeats (`actuator.heartbeat.{channel}`), that channel routes to hardware. Otherwise it routes to MuJoCo. Plug in a real arm → manipulation goes real, locomotion stays virtual. Unplug → falls back to MuJoCo after timeout.

**R-STDP on motor pathways**: Prediction error gates motor learning — successful motor outcomes reinforce the firing patterns that produced them. Motor echo tracker provides DA boost for 100 steps after motor fire, keeping eligibility traces alive during the feedback delay.

### Governance Pipeline

Four services form an autonomous self-improvement and safety pipeline. All proposals (action or code) must pass through the Kernel before execution.

| Service | Role | Key NATS Subjects |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel** | Immutable safety gate. Evaluates all proposals against envelope limits, risk thresholds, and belief norms. | `proposal.new`, `code.proposal` → `decision.{trace_id}` |
| **Safety Supervisor** | Risk analysis via request-reply. Checks dangerous patterns, self-referential code, protected paths. | `safety.analyze.action`, `safety.analyze.code` |
| **Coordinator** | Routes unknown devices to meta-programmer, manages sensor discovery, deduplicates knowledge gaps. | `device.unknown`, `task.request` |
| **Meta-Programmer** | Generates plugin code via Ollama, runs in sandboxed containers, submits to Kernel for approval. | `knowledge.gap` → `code.proposal` |

### Reminiscence Bump & Adolescent Plasticity
The brain's developmental model includes an "adolescent" supercharged learning phase inspired by the reminiscence bump — the neurobiological phenomenon where experiences during ages 10-25 are wired into core identity with extraordinary durability.

> **Naming:** Engram is the product/brand name and the domain is `engram.ai`. "Engram" was a former brand name and "ActiveLearningAI" is the original project directory name — both are still retained in a few places (the GitHub org/repos, the `activelearning` Python packages, and the legal entity Engram Incorporated). Public-facing materials use Engram.

## Known Limitations

Engram is a research system, and we believe in being honest about its current state:

- **Performance / scale.** The core simulation is Python + NumPy/SciPy. It runs
  and learns, but it is **not real-time** at the ~1M-neuron scale on commodity
  hardware. Real-time embodied use will require GPU/compiled kernels or
  neuromorphic hardware (e.g. Loihi, SpiNNaker).
- **Validation.** Emergent concept formation and continual learning are
  implemented and unit-tested, but large-scale, quantitative evidence that the
  system learns *useful* abstractions is still a work in progress.
- **Meta-Programmer.** Autonomous code generation uses a local LLM and runs in a
  sandbox, but generated drivers are experimental, not production-grade.
- **Hardware integration.** Built-in sensors cover camera, microphone, and serial
  devices; IMU / depth / real-actuator support is partial or planned.
- **Contribution opportunities.** The `good first issue` backlog (issues labelled
  [`good first issue`](https://github.com/DPBG/Engram.AI/labels/good%20first%20issue))
  lists small, well-scoped tasks across `neuromorphic/`, `sdk/`, and
  `sensory-gateway/`. Contributions are especially welcome.

If something doesn't match the docs, please open an issue — accurate docs are a priority.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few essentials:

- **Open pull requests against the [`dev`](https://github.com/DPBG/Engram.AI/tree/dev) branch**, not `main`. `dev` is the
  integration branch; `main` is the stable/release branch that `dev` is merged
  into for releases.
- Branch from `dev` (`git checkout dev && git checkout -b feature/your-feature`),
  make your change, and open the PR with **base: `dev`**.
- Run the tests before pushing — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
  full workflow, code standards, and the architecture invariants in
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Gittensor Driven Development

Engram is developed by **[Gittensor](https://gittensor.io)** — **Bittensor Subnet 74 (SN74)**, a decentralized network that rewards open-source contributions. Its contributors deliver Engram's features and fixes through the [`dev`-branch PR workflow](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Without Gittensor, this project couldn't have come so far** — its contributor network drives Engram's development forward.
