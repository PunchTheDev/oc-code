"""Regression tests: unified.db schema migration path (issue #262).

Proves that a database with an outdated column set is migrated correctly on
startup — ALTER TABLE statements in _MIGRATIONS apply to existing tables, and
existing rows survive untouched.

Async code is driven through asyncio.run() so pytest-asyncio is not required.
