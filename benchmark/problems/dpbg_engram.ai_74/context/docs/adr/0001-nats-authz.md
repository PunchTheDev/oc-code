# 0001 — NATS account & permission model

- **Status:** Proposed (awaiting maintainer security review)
- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Tracking issue:** [#64](https://github.com/DPBG/Engram.AI/issues/64) (E1.1.1)
- **Milestone:** M1 — Safety Real
- **Phase:** 1 (Safety hardening). Blocks the rest of Task 1.1 (per-service
  credentials, enforced allowlists, red-team test).
- **Related:** Decision signing (Task 1.2, [#36](https://github.com/DPBG/Engram.AI/pull/36)),
  operator/dashboard publisher scope (Task 1.7).

---

## Context

`deploy/nats-1m.conf` authenticates every client with a **single shared token**:

```hocon
authorization {
  token: $NATS_TOKEN
}
```

There are no per-service users and no subject permissions, so the broker
enforces *nothing* about **who** may publish **what**. Any process holding
`$NATS_TOKEN` can publish on any subject — including the safety-critical ones.
Concretely, a compromised or buggy non-Kernel service could publish a forged
`decision.<trace_id>` and a waiter (`EventBus.wait_for_decision`) would receive
it off the bus.

Decision signing (Task 1.2) already defends the *application* layer: a
`decision.*` payload without a valid signature is rejected by `verify_decision`
in `sdk/.../nats_client.py`. That assumes a **hostile bus**. This ADR closes the
complementary gap: make the **bus itself** least-privilege so unauthorized
publishes are refused at the transport layer, before any service has to reason
about them. Defense in depth — signing and transport authz are independent
layers, and neither replaces the other.

This ADR is a **design** deliverable. It specifies the model and the complete
subject × service matrix. Generating per-service credentials, switching
`nats-1m.conf` to the account model, and the red-team test are follow-up issues
that this one unblocks.

### Architectural invariants

This change touches the safety architecture (CLAUDE.md §3). It only ever
**adds** restrictions to the bus; it never weakens the ability to gate, deny, or
transform an action, and it is **fail-closed** (see *Dev-mode vs enforced-mode*).
No neuromorphic invariant is affected.

## Decision

### 1. One account per trust domain, one user per service

NATS has two nesting levels of isolation:

- **Accounts** are hard isolation boundaries: subjects do **not** cross account
  lines unless explicitly exported/imported. Two services in different accounts
  cannot see each other's subjects at all.
- **Users** live inside an account, share its subject space, and each carry
  their own publish/subscribe permission allowlist.

Engram's services form **one cooperating message fabric** — almost every subject
is meant to be visible to the right counterpart service — so hard account
isolation per service would require dozens of export/import pairs and fight the
design. We therefore use:

- A single **`ENGRAM`** account containing the whole service fabric, with **one
  user per service**, each with an explicit publish/subscribe allowlist
  (sections 3–4). This is where least-privilege is enforced.
- A separate **`SYS`** account (NATS system account) for operations/monitoring
  only, not used by application services.

This keeps the subject namespace flat (no import/export plumbing) while still
giving every service its own credential and its own allowlist. If a future
service must be *hard*-isolated (e.g. an untrusted third-party plugin), it can be
promoted to its own account with explicit exports — the model leaves room for
that without reworking the common case.

### 2. Credential mechanism: NKEY + signed user JWT (decentralized auth)

Use NATS **decentralized auth** (operator → account → user JWTs, NKEY-signed),
not the static `authorization { users: [...] }` block:

- Each service gets a **user JWT** + its **NKEY seed**, distributed as a single
  `.creds` file. The broker is configured with the account's public key only; it
  never holds any service's private seed.
- Permissions are baked into the signed JWT, so they cannot be tampered with in
  transit and rotating one service's credential does not require editing a
  central server config or restarting the broker.
- This mirrors the credential-as-config pattern already used for decision
  signing (`ENGRAM_DECISION_KEY`): the secret lives in a file/env var supplied
  to the process, not in shared source.

Rejected alternative — static `users` list in `nats-1m.conf`: simpler, but every
credential and permission lives in one server-side file, rotation means editing
+ reloading the server, and there is no per-service private key. Acceptable for a
first cut but it does not scale to per-service rotation; decentralized JWT is the
target. (A static-users variant MAY be used as a transitional implementation in
the follow-up issue, as long as the same matrix below is enforced.)

#### Credential distribution

| Runtime | How the `.creds` reaches the service |
|---|---|
| `run.py` (pure Python) | Launcher generates/loads a `.creds` per service into a gitignored `secrets/` dir and passes its path via `NATS_CREDS` env var; `EventBus.connect()` passes it to `nats.connect(..., user_credentials=...)`. |
| Docker Compose | Each service container mounts its own `.creds` (Docker secret / read-only bind mount); `NATS_CREDS` points at the mount path. The broker mounts only the operator/account public JWTs. |

No service ever receives another service's seed. The `secrets/` directory and
`*.creds` are gitignored; only the **account public** material is committed.

### 3. The privileged Kernel publisher set (global rule)

**Only the `kernel` user may publish** the following subjects. Every other
service's allowlist explicitly omits publish on them; the Kernel is the sole
authority that may emit a decision (CLAUDE.md §3):

| Privileged subject | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `decision.>` | Per-trace action decisions (`decision.<trace_id>`). |
| `code.decision.>` | Per-trace code-proposal decisions. |
| `policy.*` | Policy state the Kernel owns (`policy.restrict`, `policy.update`, `policy.rollback`, `policy.load_profile`, and `policy.*.status`). |
| `cognitive.response.validated` | Kernel's attestation that a cognitive/LLM response passed validation. |

> **⚠ Conflict surfaced by the audit — must be resolved by the implementation
> issue.** `neuromorphic/src/neuromorphic/service.py` currently publishes
> `policy.restrict` directly (lines ~1496 and ~1509). Under this rule the brain
> may **not** publish `policy.*`. The brain must instead *request* a restriction
> via a non-privileged subject (proposal: `policy.restrict.request`) that the
> Kernel subscribes to and, if it agrees, re-publishes as the authoritative
> `policy.restrict`. The matrix below encodes the **target** state
> (`neuromorphic` → publish `policy.restrict.request`, not `policy.restrict`).
> Shipping enforcement before this refactor would break the brain's halt path,
> so the two land together.

### 4. The operator / dashboard publisher set

The `dashboard` user is the human operator's hands. It may publish the
operator-control and command subjects (halt/resume, policy commands, probes,
sensory-gateway commands, motor guidance, approval responses) but is **not** in
the privileged Kernel set — an operator asks the Kernel to halt
(`safety.halt`); the operator does not forge a `decision.*`. This ties to Task
1.7 (operator publisher scope). The dashboard's broad `>` subscription
(read-everything, for the live UI) is **subscribe-only** and stays; it grants no
publish rights.

### 5. Deny-by-default allowlists

Every user's JWT sets `publish`/`subscribe` to an **explicit allow list**.
Anything not listed is denied. The default NATS behavior (allow-all) is never
used for an application user. The matrix in the next section is the source of
truth for these lists.

### 6. Dev-mode vs enforced-mode (fail-safe-by-config)

Mirror the `ENGRAM_DECISION_KEY` pattern (signing is enforced when a key is
configured, and the system fails closed when it should be on but isn't):

- **Enforced mode (production, default for deploy):** the broker uses the
  account model; services must present a valid `.creds`. This is the Hetzner /
  `deploy/` configuration. A service with no/invalid creds cannot connect — fail
  closed.
- **Dev-mode (local `run.py`, opt-in):** a single permissive credential is
  allowed *only* when an explicit env flag (e.g. `ENGRAM_NATS_DEV=1`) is set, so
  contributors can run the stack without minting per-service creds. The launcher
  logs a clear warning that authz is not enforced.
- **Fail-safe rule:** absence of configuration must not silently degrade to
  allow-all in a deployed environment. The deploy path sets enforced mode
  explicitly; if the enforced config is selected but creds are missing, the
  service fails to start rather than falling back to the shared token.

## Subject × service permission matrix

This is the acceptance-criteria artifact: for **every subject in the
codebase**, exactly which service(s) may **publish** (P) and **subscribe** (S).
Service keys: `kernel`, `safety` (safety-supervisor), `beliefs`, `memory`,
`coordinator`, `planner`, `neuro` (neuromorphic), `meta` (meta-programmer),
`cache`, `extapi` (external-api), `overrides`, `dashboard` (also the operator),
`gateway` (sensory-gateway). "operator" = the human, acting through `dashboard`.

`>` and `*` are NATS wildcards. A row whose subject ends in `>` / `*` is a
prefix/token family; the allowlist entry uses the wildcard form.

> Source-of-truth note: the named constants in this table are mirrored in
> `sdk/src/activelearning/subjects.py`. `sdk/tests/test_adr_subject_matrix.py`
> fails CI if a constant there is missing from this document, so the matrix and
> the code cannot silently drift.

## Consequences

### Positive

- A compromised non-Kernel service can no longer forge `decision.*`,
  `code.decision.*`, `policy.*`, or `cognitive.response.validated` at the
  transport layer — defense in depth on top of decision signing.
- Every service has its own rotatable credential; revoking one does not affect
  others and does not require sharing a global token.
- The matrix above is an executable contract: the CI test ties it to
  `subjects.py`, so adding a subject without documenting its authz fails the
  build.

### Negative / costs

- **Operational surface:** per-service `.creds` must be generated, distributed,
  and rotated. The `run.py` dev-mode fallback mitigates local friction.
- **Refactor required before enforcement:** `neuromorphic` must stop publishing
  `policy.restrict` directly (§3). Enforcing the matrix before that lands would
  break the brain's restriction path, so they ship together.
- **Wildcard subscribers:** the dashboard's `>` subscription is broad by
  necessity (live UI). It is read-only, but it does mean the operator credential
  can observe all traffic — acceptable, since the operator is trusted, and it
  cannot publish outside its allowlist.
- Request/reply replies go to ephemeral `_INBOX.>` subjects; every service that
  uses `request()` needs publish on `_INBOX.>` and subscribe on its own inbox.
  The implementation issue must include the standard `_INBOX.>` grant in each
  user's allowlist (NATS convention) so request/reply keeps working.

### Follow-up (unblocked by this ADR)

1. Generate per-service NKEY/JWT creds + wire `NATS_CREDS` into `EventBus` and
   both runtimes.
2. Replace the shared-token block in `deploy/nats-1m.conf` with the account
   model and commit the account public JWT only.
3. Refactor `neuromorphic` `policy.restrict` → `policy.restrict.request`.
4. Red-team test: assert a non-Kernel credential is **refused** when it tries to
   publish `decision.*` / `policy.*`.
