"""Minimal BaseService subclass for the kill-mid-shutdown chaos test (#260).

Not a real product service -- exists only so
test_base_service_shutdown_chaos.py can run a real subprocess to kill.
Subscribes to a JetStream subject (must be a decision.* subject supplied by
the test -- js_subscribe validates the payload against a registered wire
schema per subject, and decision.* is already covered by the safety stream
with a permissive {trace_id, type, reason (+extra fields ok)} schema, same
convention as sdk/tests/test_jetstream_durability.py). On each message,
writes a "started" marker file, sleeps (simulating slow processing), then
writes a "completed" marker file immediately before returning (i.e.
immediately before js_subscribe's callback acks). The test freezes+kills
this process during the sleep window, then inspects which marker files
exist to prove message processing was interrupted before ack, and asks a
second consumer whether the broker redelivered.

Run as a subprocess:
    python -m activelearning._chaos_kill_service
    (reads NATS_URL, CHAOS_SUBJECT, CHAOS_DURABLE, CHAOS_MARKER_DIR,
    CHAOS_SLEEP_SECONDS from the environment)
