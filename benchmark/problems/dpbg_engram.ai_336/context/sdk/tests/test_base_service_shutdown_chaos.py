"""Chaos test (M2.37, issue #260): a process killed mid-message-handling.

BaseService.stop()'s cooperative shutdown (_cleanup() then event_bus.close(),
which drains) is untested against the harsher case this issue actually names:
the process itself dying (crash, OOM kill, SIGKILL) while a js_subscribe
handler is mid-flight, not a clean signal-driven stop(). A cooperative
drain() never runs at all in that case.

js_subscribe's documented contract (nats_client.py) is explicit ack only
after the handler returns -- so a process killed before that point should
never ack, and the broker should redeliver to whoever consumes the same
durable next. This test proves that end-to-end against a real broker and a
real subprocess (activelearning._chaos_kill_service), rather than trusting
the docstring on inspection -- the same "prove it, don't just read the
code" standard this milestone's other issues (e.g. #258) apply elsewhere.

Uses SIGSTOP-then-SIGKILL (not a timing race) to deterministically kill the
process while it is in the middle of its simulated processing sleep,
mirroring kernel/tests/test_kernel_crash_chaos.py's reasoning.
