"""
Red-team payload corpus for the meta-programmer sandbox (M1.11).

Each test in this module exercises a distinct class of known Python sandbox-escape
technique against the fully-hardened container.  The structure mirrors
test_sandbox_containment_integration.py: a two-step adversarial check —

  1. Baseline  — the payload SUCCEEDS when the relevant guard is absent or the
                 technique is known to work in an unrestricted Python process.
  2. Guarded   — the same payload is BLOCKED under full production hardening.

Technique categories covered
-----------------------------
1.  __subclasses__ chain             — walk MRO to reach os.system / Popen
2.  __globals__ / frame inspection   — climb call frames to read builtins
3.  ctypes / CDLL                    — call libc directly
4.  pickle deserialization           — __reduce__ + os.system
5.  importlib / __import__           — dynamic module loading after restriction
6.  /proc/self/mem write             — write executable memory via procfs
7.  Resource exhaustion — CPU        — spin a tight loop to starve the CPU quota
8.  Resource exhaustion — disk /tmp  — fill the /tmp tmpfs (size=50M)
9.  Symlink escape                   — symlink inside /tmp to escape to /etc
10. Environment variable leak        — read inherited env vars for secrets

Payloads exit 0 on SUCCESS (containment worked / technique was blocked) or
non-zero on FAILURE (technique succeeded — sandbox must file a follow-up).

Requirements: Docker daemon running AND activelearning-sandbox:latest built.
  Build: docker compose --profile build-only build sandbox-base
