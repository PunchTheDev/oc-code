"""Un-boxed LaTeX ``\\frac``/``\\sqrt`` final answers must be extracted whole.

``extract_last_number`` is the math fallback when no ``\\boxed{...}`` is
present. Its digit-only alternatives read an inline-LaTeX answer such as
``$\\frac{1}{2}$`` as its operand digits and return the denominator (``2``) —
and ``$2\\sqrt{3}$`` as the radicand (``3``). The grader then compares a value
the model never answered: the true reference fails (false negative) and a
reference that happens to equal the operand digit passes (false positive).
This also poisons ``has_answer``, committed-answer selection, and the HERO
self-consistency vote, which all share the extractor.

These tests pin the fix: LaTeX fraction/radical terms are captured as one
token, while the "last plain number still wins" contract is preserved.
