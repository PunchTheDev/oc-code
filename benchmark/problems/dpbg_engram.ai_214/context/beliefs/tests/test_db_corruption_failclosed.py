"""Fail-closed regression tests for issue #205 (M1.12).

``BeliefsService._load_from_db`` used to wrap the entire node/edge load in a
bare ``except Exception: log warning, continue``, then fall straight through
to ``seed_constitutional_beliefs()`` — corruption got silently treated as
"first boot" and constitutional VALUEs got reseeded from hardcoded defaults
rather than halting. This directly contradicts CLAUDE.md §3's fail-closed
rule ("if a check cannot run, deny/halt — never degrade open").

These tests stub ``self.database`` rather than corrupting a real SQLite
file: reliably reproducing "database disk image is malformed" via raw byte
corruption turns out to be non-deterministic (SQLite recovers from a lot of
naive corruption attempts), while a stub deterministically reproduces the
exact code path this issue is about — ``fetchall()`` raising — the same
style ``kernel/tests/test_service.py`` already uses for the Kernel's
analogous fail-closed-on-internal-error coverage.

Uses ``asyncio.run()`` rather than ``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` since the
Governance CI job runs ``beliefs/tests`` with ``--with pytest --with
networkx`` only — no pytest-asyncio installed in that step.
