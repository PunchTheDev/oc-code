// #8691: bin/loopover-mcp.ts attaches no "error" listener to process.stdout/stderr, so a broken pipe
// (EPIPE — the downstream reader in `... | head` closes after a few bytes, while the CLI is still writing a
// large payload) surfaced as an uncaught `Error: write EPIPE` and crashed the whole CLI with a stack trace
// instead of exiting cleanly. `tools` is a deterministic, offline, large (~27KB, many separate writes)
// payload — piping it into a reader that grabs a handful of bytes and exits reliably reproduces the race.
// These tests spawn the real compiled dist CLI (like the rest of the mcp-cli-*.test.ts harness), so they
// require `npm run build:mcp` to have run first — CI's "Build MCP" step and local `npm run test:ci` do that.
