"""Offline R5 check: does TRINITY reach the Per-Question-Best ceiling?

``docs/SPEC.md`` §1.3 invariant **R5** — *"TRINITY ≈ Per-Question-Best on 3 of 4
in-dist tasks"* — is a replication requirement, yet nothing in ``src/`` or
``scripts/`` verifies it. The **Per-Question-Best (PQB)** upper bound is the
*"union of correct answers across the pool"* (SPEC §5.2): the fraction of
questions some pool model answers correctly, i.e. the accuracy a per-question
oracle router would reach. R5 is the claim that the *trained* router very nearly
reaches that ceiling — it captures the routable signal, not just part of it.

This reads, per benchmark, TRINITY's accuracy and the benchmark's PQB ceiling,
and reports the gap ``PQB - TRINITY``, whether TRINITY is within ``tol`` of the
ceiling ("≈"), and the R5 verdict across benchmarks (TRINITY is ≈ PQB on at least
``min_pass`` of them — by default all-but-one, matching the paper's "3 of 4").
Equal benchmark weighting for the union mean gap, matching the composite score
(ROADMAP Phase 2).

``per_question_best`` is the same quantity ``trinity.analysis.union_oracle`` and
``scripts/oracle_ceiling.py`` already estimate (the routing/union oracle) — this
module does not recompute it; it consumes it and adds the TRINITY comparison R5
needs. Pure numpy/stdlib over plain numbers — no torch, no network, no GPU.
