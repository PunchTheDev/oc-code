"""SQLite WAL-mode behavior under concurrent service writes (issue #231).

Several services share one SQLite file in production (CLAUDE.md: "persist to
SQLite"; docker-compose.yml points kernel, safety-supervisor, beliefs,
planner, external-api, memory, cache, and coordinator at the same
``unified.db``). These tests exercise that scenario directly against the real
``Database`` class (no mocking of aiosqlite/sqlite3) and pin down the two
regimes that matter:

1. Concurrent *first-time* ``initialize()`` -- multiple services starting up
   at once against a brand-new file. See docs/sqlite-wal-concurrency.md for
   the measured failure rate this uncovered and the retry-with-backoff fix
   in ``Database.initialize()``.
2. Concurrent *steady-state* writes -- once the schema/WAL mode already
   exist, many services inserting concurrently.
