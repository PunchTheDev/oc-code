/** Opt-in PostHog error tracking for the miner CLI (#8292, epic #8286 Phase 1). Complete no-op unless
 * LOOPOVER_MINER_POSTHOG_API_KEY is set -- an operator points this at their OWN PostHog project, mirroring
 * sentry.ts's identical no-phone-home posture (#6011): this is a published, independently-installed CLI
 * (@loopover/miner), so nothing here is ever auto-enabled or phones home by default. `posthog-node` is
 * lazy-imported only inside `initMinerPostHog()` so a miner invocation that never opts in pays zero
 * module-load cost -- this CLI runs very frequently under an unattended loop (lib/loop-cli.js).
 *
 * Runs ALONGSIDE sentry.ts during the epic's parallel-run window (both capture when both configured) --
 * this is a new sink, not a replacement, until a gated Sentry-decommission sub-issue lands.
 *
 * Short-lived-process flush semantics (`flushAt: 1, flushInterval: 0`): the miner CLI runs frequently and
 * exits quickly, so posthog-node's default batching would likely lose events to process exit before a
 * batched flush ever fires -- the exact pattern packages/loopover-mcp/lib/telemetry.ts (#6238) already
 * proves for opt-in CLI telemetry.
