"""Chaos test (M2.40): KernelWatchdog loses its own NATS connection.

``launcher/watchdog.py`` (E1.9.3) catches Kernel loss via ``kernel.heartbeat``.
Untested until now: what happens if the *watchdog itself* loses NATS while the
broker and a live heartbeat publisher keep running.

Unsafe failure mode: the watchdog goes blind, reconnects, accepts resumed
heartbeats, and silently continues — never SAFE_HALTing, even though it cannot
vouch for kernel liveness during the gap.

Safe failure mode: after a blind period longer than the watchdog timeout,
reconnect mandates ``safety.halt`` (fail toward SAFE_HALT). Heartbeats that
resume after reconnect must not cancel that mandate.

This spins up a real ``nats-server``, a heartbeat publisher on a *separate*
NATS client (kernel still "alive"), and a watchdog client whose reconnect is
artificially delayed past the timeout via ``reconnect_to_server_handler`` —
so only the watchdog's connection is down, not the whole broker.

Follows ``kernel/tests/test_kernel_crash_chaos.py``'s convention of driving
async code through ``asyncio.run()`` (no pytest-asyncio required).
