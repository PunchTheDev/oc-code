"""Experimental GPU-accelerated CSR synapse ops (issue #135 research spike).

Scope: this module ports ONLY the sparse-dense matrix-vector product in
``SynapseGroup.compute_current`` (spike propagation) to JAX. STDP/R-STDP/
BCM/eligibility-trace updates are deliberately NOT ported here — they use
data-dependent-shape sparse gathering and in-place CSR-data mutation
(``synapses.py``'s ``_gather_active_synapses`` / ``update_weights_stdp``),
which fights JAX's static-shape JIT model and would need a substantial
masked/dense-shadow rewrite to fit. See docs/GPU-SYNAPSE-BACKEND-FEASIBILITY.md
for the full writeup, including why this module is NOT wired into
``SynapseGroup`` as a live runtime option: CPU-only benchmarking here found
it consistently slower than the existing hand-tuned scipy CPU path, so it
is kept as a standalone, independently-tested module pending real GPU
hardware validation.

Design intent (per the issue's acceptance criteria):
- Functional equivalence with the CPU implementation (see test_gpu_synapse_ops.py).
- "GPU when available, CPU otherwise" comes from JAX's own device model —
  the same code runs on whatever ``jax.devices()`` resolves to. No hand-rolled
  CuPy-style try/except-GPU-then-numpy dance is needed.
- No new hard dependency: jax/jaxlib are only imported inside functions here,
  never at module import time, so the rest of neuromorphic works unmodified
  without the optional ``gpu`` extra installed (``pip install .[gpu]``).
